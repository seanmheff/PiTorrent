# An example init script for running a Node.js process as a service
# using Forever as the process monitor. For more configuration options
# associated with Forever, see: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever
#
# You will need to set the environment variables noted below to conform to
# your use case, and change the init info comment block.
#
# This was written for Debian distributions such as Ubuntu, but should still
# work on RedHat, Fedora, or other RPM-based distributions, since none
# of the built-in service functions are used. If you do adapt it to a RPM-based
# system, you'll need to replace the init info comment block with a chkconfig
# comment block.
